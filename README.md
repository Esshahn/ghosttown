# Ghost Town

I'm trying to convert the original Ghost Town game for the Commodore 264 series to HTML5 and JavaScript. Let's see how far I get, this is a video of a complete playthrough of the game (SP0IL0RZ AL3RTZ!!1): http://playible.com


## Technology

Not sure which technology to use along the way, but it will probably be something like

* HTML (duh!)
* JavaScript (finally a project with a high class programming language)
* CoffeeScript (honestly, I don't like it yet, but it's part of the plan to get used to it)
* Pixi.js
* Maybe Phaser ( http://phaser.io/ )
* Some other shit I find useful on the way


## Installing the project & dependencies

Don't install it. Don't even download it. Yet.
It's really nothing so far, but if you're into epic disappointments - by all means go ahead!
No dependencies.
